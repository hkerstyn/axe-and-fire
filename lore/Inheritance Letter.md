Dear Ms. Farther,

unfortunately we must inform you that you grandfather, Mr. Grant Farther, recently passed away due to old age. In his testament, he decreed that you shall inherit his agriculutural and residential property "Farthest Field", along with the surrounding land.
The property ownership deed alongside the house keys will be available for pickup at Russeau's notary office in Chanceton.

Our sincerest regards,
Cupped & Sabre
