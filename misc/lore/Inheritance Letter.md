Dear Ms. Farther,

unfortunately we must inform you that you grandfather, Mr. Trentyn Farther, recently passed away. In his testament, he decreed that you shall inherit his property "Farthest Field"
as well as the surrounding land.
The property ownership deed alongside the house keys will be available for pickup at Russeau's notary office in Altine.
Furthermore we must ask you to come to our office in person to testify
that your inheritance has been received.

Our sincerest regards,
Hugo Cupped & Elesibeth Sabre
