Hi Elly,

so, apparently grandpa had some old farm in Cathedral and
set you to inherit it.
I got some letter from some Cathedrian lawyers,
they want you to do a bunch of legal stuff there.
I'll attach it here.
Anyway, love you and if you want to talk, my new phone number
is 1151.

Hugs and kisses,
Dad
