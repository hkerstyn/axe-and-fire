Are you a true Cathebian?

if &ans in ["what", "cathedrian"]:
	Well as you know,
	our great country is called Cathebes.
	"Cathedrial" is the name
	our Dommestrian opressors gave it.

	So I ask you again,
	are you a true Cathebian?
	option yes = Yes:
	option no = No:
		Then get the hell outta here!
		&bad_answer = true
		quit:

	option Don't you mean Demestrian?:
		Oh yeah, they call themselves that now.
		Anyway, thanks to their little revolution,
		all their pissy nobles fled here
		and we have to suffer through their bullshit.


	if true:
		option You mean the Iris conflict?:
			What? No.
			The worst oppressor is the Duchess
			and all the other inbred dommestrian nobles
			that came here after the revolution.


	if true:
		option Don't you get cold?:
			The wish for freedom keeps me awake at night.
	flush:
	if not &ans == "yes":
		So one last time.
		Are you a true Cathebian?
		option yes = Yes:
		option no = No:
			Then quit wasting my time.

Awesome!
If you want to help free this country,
go to Aries and talk to my brothers and sisters there.
Take this!
